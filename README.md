# Variational Autoencoder using Tensorflow 2.x

This code is using only for educational propose. 
This demonstrate a variational autoencoder  using tensorflow interfaces
and good pratices.

This project have a GUI to experiments the autoencoder results
by set the latent space manualy. 

# Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run
```
 python train.py
```

## Open in tensorboard (Run after train)
```
tensorboard --logdir tensorboard
```


After training process, a window will open for your own experiments.
